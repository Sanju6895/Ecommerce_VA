We can have multiple settings.py type of files for various env like
dev and prod.

To do this we make a new folder in core app (For this project as its the main one)
as settings and make it a package __init__.py

Next we put all different config.seetings.py files as per perference.

Once we do this we have to make changes in to place;
manage.py and the seetings file's BASE_DIR
In manage.py change the os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "core.settings.THIS_WILL_BE_NEW_SETTINGS.py_FILE")
and in THIS_WILL_BE_NEW_SETTINGS.py file change BASE_DIR to go up one more parent
